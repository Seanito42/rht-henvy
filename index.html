Miigwech. Gabuzyan (ph). Thank you for coming out today. I&#39;m Chief McQuabbie.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />We&#39;re going to have a presentation today from the Mizhinawe. He&#39;ll be talking to our members about the moving forward with the annuities. So as always, we start out with opening prayer. So we&#39;ll have Councillor Stan Moses do the opening prayer. Miigwech.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>COUNCILLOR MOSES:: </strong><br />I just want to give thanks for this day. I&#39;m happy that everybody made it here safely; I give thanks to Creator for that. And when you guys return to your homes, I give thanks for that, that you make it there in a safe way. And it&#39;s a beautiful day; it&#39;s a momentous day for us, but this is just a part of things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>COUNCILLOR MOSES:: </strong><br />I just want to make sure that I just give thanks to (Ojibwe language), and all those ones that help us along.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>COUNCILLOR MOSES:: </strong><br />Miigwech.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Again, thank you to all the Henvey members for coming out today. Start with some opening comments.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />As Chief and our Council, we&#39;re honoured to be here today to start this process. We&#39;ve worked very hard as Chiefs, Trustees, and Litigation Management Committee with our legal team to negotiate a resolution to the past compensation component of the annuity’s litigation. I have the privilege to work on this file as Chief of our community for years, as well as our Councillor Brenda Contin. She had this file, and she&#39;s also present today.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />It goes without saying that the Litigation Management Committee has worked tirelessly over the last 15 years or so to get to this settlement. I have worked closely with the LMC and happy to see our Chair, Mike Restoule from Nipissing, Peter Recollet from Wahnapitae, and Duke Peltier from Wiikwemikoong here today; sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />The settlement could not have been achieved without the political relationship with Canada and Ontario, and the strategy employed by our legal team. The Litigation Management Committee has special responsibilities as the Trustees tasked with managing the claim and instructing our legal team.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />I am thankful for the work of the Litigation Management Committee. This Settlement Agreement is just the first step. We still have a lot of work to do in negotiating the future implementation of the Augmentation Promise. The Litigation Management Committee, Trustees, and Chiefs are committed to doing this important work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />It has been difficult working under litigation and settlement privilege. We are limited in the information we could share with the communities. I am pleased that we can now speak directly to our people as the Trust Chiefs and Mizhinawe about the prospect of settlement and next steps.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />We must remind the community that this agreement in principle is still subject to settlement privilege. We can only share information with community members, but not the general public.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />I know you all understand and respect this. We will work to create a secure portal where members will be able to access information about the settlement and consultations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />We are also happy to be here with the Mizhinawe. The Honourable Harry LaForme is here to update you on their mandate and hear your views on settlement implementation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />The Chiefs: I met with the Chiefs in Sagamok on the 26th, and there&#39;s still a lot of questions from the Chiefs, too. You know, we&#39;re in discussions with the Litigation Management Committee, and legal yet; there&#39;s still a lot of unanswered questions moving forward; again, these are first steps. And there&#39;s a meeting scheduled in Sault Ste. Marie for August 31st and September 1st for all leaders. So that&#39;ll be an important meeting moving forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Again, you know, at this point, our First Nation doesn&#39;t know what, you know, our portion of that $10 billion settlement is going to be. So once we find that out and the agreement is actually signed, at that point our community will start its consultations with its membership to find a resolution and how we&#39;re going to disburse those funds and whatnot.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />And I was mistaken in our count for our membership. We are currently at 1,206 souls within our membership. That is also including the individuals that are waiting on our new membership code. So, you know, they are also recipients of the settlement claim; I just want to make that clear.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />So we&#39;ll -- you know, we&#39;ll get started with the Mizhinawe, but this this is also for the membership to have that discussion and ask those questions with the Mizhinawe. So we&#39;ll get started.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Miigwech for -- again, for being here today.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />You wanted to shake my hand?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />I assume you wanted to give the mic away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So Miigwech. (Speaking in Ojibwe language).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Duke Peltier; I&#39;m a Trustee supporting the Robinson-Huron Treaty Litigation Fund, and a representative of Wiikwemkoong Unceded territory. And I&#39;ve been a Trustee since 2010 and a member of the -- appointed to -- by the Trustees as a member of the Litigation Management Committee, and also appointed by the Chiefs as a spokesperson on behalf of the Chiefs for the Robinson-Huron Treaty Litigation Fund. And I&#39;ve been actively performing in that role since, I guess, when they appointed me back in 2012 on being a spokesperson.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So it&#39;s -- I’m very honoured to be able to do that role. And I&#39;ve been asked by Mizhinawe Harry LaForme, Justice Harry LaForme, to support his engagement process that he&#39;s been hired by the Robinson-Huron Treaty Litigation Fund to provide some background on the litigation, as well as some of the history, some of the negotiations, as well as what some of the next steps are, and to provide some commentary on some of the -- I guess, the inner workings of how we got to this point.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />By saying that I want to -- I do want to say that I&#39;m going to give an opportunity here for Justice Harry LaForme to explain the role of Mizhinawe, and why he&#39;s been appointed, what his responsibility is, and what he&#39;s been tasked to provide to the leadership.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />But by saying that, I do have to say, and echo the sentiments of Chief McQuabbie, in saying that there are still many decisions that haven&#39;t been made. There won&#39;t be any decisions made today either, just so that you know. And that our intention today is for us to provide some of the most accurate information that we can provide to you, as opposed to some other sources that you may have been getting some information from, but we wanted to provide that opportunity. And the goal of Mizhinawe here is to hear your views in order to help him develop a report that will support the leadership in making decisions on behalf of all the beneficiaries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So with that, I&#39;m going to pass the virtual microphone over to Justice Harry LaForme so he can greet Henvey Inlet First Nation and provide his overview of his role.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So Harry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Thank you, Duke.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Everyone can hear me okay? Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Thank you. Miigwech, Duke. Aniin to everyone there, and thank you for coming out. It&#39;s a -- I wish I was there; I can&#39;t be there, but there&#39;s such a heavy schedule that we have to do between now and the end of this process for this first stage, and I can&#39;t be at every one. And I apologize for not being able to be with you today.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />First, I want to tell you that I want to bring you the greetings and congratulations from my own First Nation, Mississaugas of the Credit, and those congratulations are supplemented with well-wishes and much success in your Treaty implementation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I&#39;m an Anishinaabe and a member of that First Nation. Indeed, I&#39;m actually sitting on the territory -- the Treaty territory of Mississaugas of the Credit. And so the -- be guided by my ancestors and what I say.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />So miigwech for allowing me into your community, and my responsibilities as Mizhinawe.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Before I begin, I&#39;d like to say miigwech to the opening prayer and the ceremony, and the thoughts on how we should proceed and guidance and comments. So miigwech.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />To start, and for those who may not know me, and I know there are some of you -- I&#39;ve been reminded of that -- that I&#39;d like to tell you a little about myself. The reason I think that that I should is because it&#39;s important. I believe that, you know, the people that are working with you, and especially in this -- in this historic occasion. So let me do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I was born and raised on Mississauga of the Credit First Nation Reserve, and I began my journey as an Indigenous man pursuing a rightful place in Canada with the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians. That was back in the early seventies when organizations were -- Indigenous organizations were springing up across Canada to oppose the White Paper policy of then-Prime Minister Trudeau. And as I say, that was in the early seventies.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />From there it was off to law school in 1974. I was among the first Indigenous students to attend law school at this time. And I always like to mention this, that there were only four Indigenous lawyers in all of Canada at that time, so there was a need for us to occupy this field a little bit. And I soon fell in love with the law, and I knew that it had a place for Indigenous rights in Canada.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I was also one of the first to practice law whose speciality was Indigenous law. In fact, some of my first clients were from the Robinson-Huron First Nations, and I can only say miigwech to them for giving me the opportunity to assist them and thereby assisting me in my so far beautiful and fantastic journey that I&#39;ve been on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />That led to the appointment in the early nineties as the chairperson of the Indian Commission of Ontario.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />During this time I co-chaired, along with Chief Manny Jules from Kamloops, on the Chiefs Committee on Indigenous land claims. And we filed our report, and this in turn led to Canada asking me to establish and be the first Chair of the Indian Claims Commission. And that&#39;s been going on in various iterations, and most recently has been turned into a Tribunal with authority and more powers than it had when I first started, and I&#39;m happy to see that evolve.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />In 1994, I was appointed a judge of the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, and at that time I was one of only three Indigenous judges of that court across Canada, and I served there for 10 years.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />In 2004, I was appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and that&#39;s a special day for me because I was the first Indigenous appointment to any appellate court in the history of Canada. And there I presided for 15 years until I retired in 2018.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I joined Olthuis Kleer Townshend because -- right after I retired, because they were they were a law firm that represented Indigenous people and represented First Nations exclusively. And I felt -- I thought that I had a voice and I wanted to be heard on some of those issues, because Indigenous law had advanced so much since the last time I actually practised law, even though I kept up with it as a judge. And so for me, that seemed like the perfect landing spot for me because then I would represent Indigenous interests once again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />And in fact, that did happen. One of the first matters I was involved with, I was lead counsel for Curve Lake as one of the representative Plaintiffs in a class action against Canada for clean water on reserves. And that, at the time, became a settlement, and we negotiated those terms of settlement, and that&#39;s being implemented now as we speak.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />The next kind of project that I got involved with was Minister Lametti, who was the Justice Minister at the time, asked me to lead consultations on and report on the creation of an independent process to address wrongful convictions. And this was -- this was my way of addressing the overincarceration of our people in prison. And I took that on, and indeed, it was an opportunity to do that. And those recommendations and how to establish that independent committee were tabled with the Minister on October 31st, 19 -- or 2021, and it since became a Bill in Parliament and is to become law. I hope that works out, and I continue to hope that works out because I would like to have further say in the development and what goes into that Bill and what goes into that law and that independent process, because I feel that improvements can be made, and I think Indigenous interests can be represented there and represented better than they are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />This brings me to my appointment of Mizhinawe.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Mizhinawe. The name itself is a name that has lost in use by Indigenous -- by Anishinaabe people. And it from what I can tell in the early days and around 1850, it was for a person, a Mizhinawe was a person who was a voice between Chiefs, and through those Chiefs delivered messages and provided recommendations. And those Chiefs together would consider that and decide what course of action they would take. And that seemed like a pretty natural role for the services that I felt like I could provide, and I&#39;ve been asked to take on that position.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Now, I that that ends my history, and I think that&#39;s enough. I hope this gives you some degree of confidence that I will do my best to carry out the responsibilities of Mizhinawe in a manner that is fair and considerate and considers all of your wishes and your thoughts on this. And at the end of the day, I&#39;m going to provide a report and make recommendations on how they&#39;re going to reflect what you&#39;ve told me. They&#39;re going to reflect your opinions; they&#39;re going to reflect your suggestions; they&#39;re going to reflect all of the consultations that take place, because this is only the beginning; this is just the start of this process. And then I&#39;m going to provide that in a report and I&#39;m going to provide my recommendations based upon what I hear from you as a community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />So my duties are -- require that I collaborate with the Litigation Management Committee. At the same time, I&#39;m supposed to be independent, and I intend to function as an independent, and I will do that in collaboration with the Litigation Management Committee. And I&#39;m to engage in information sessions to ensure that the beneficiaries of the Robinson Treaty; that&#39;s your -- you people -- are aware of several things. First is the Trust indenture, and that&#39;s the instrument that I can say that basically got us here. In other words, that was the instrument used to guide the litigation, instruct counsel and those members that worked on that indenture. And I believe Daniel will have more to say about that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Then there is the Settlement Agreement for -- that&#39;s the -- that&#39;s what we just received. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve just heard announced for $10 billion by the Ministers of Canada and Ontario in late June.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />And this is -- I have to remind you, and I have to say again, this is for past compensation pursuant to the Treaty. In other words, it&#39;s for 1850, right up to the time that this Settlement Agreement is signed. And that&#39;s all; it&#39;s complete after that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />The compensation -- I should mention, the rest of anything that has to do with the augmentation clause or your rights under the augmentation clause will carry on. They will go into the future because there is -- it&#39;s about Treaty renewal. And the renewal of this Treaty means it goes forward and continues on and builds upon what we&#39;ve already established.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Then the third thing I&#39;m going to -- responsible for, and Ryan has been a tremendous help in this regard, is the Compensation Disbursement Agreement. And this was agreed to, I should say, by all the Treaty First Nations in 2012. And before anyone in this matter knew what we were going to get, if it was even going to get anything or any kind of compensation or whatever. So before all of this happened, the Chiefs had their own thoughts on how this can be distributed and fairly, and how it should be considered, keeping in mind the purpose that -- which it was signed in the first place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Today, on the information side, we&#39;re going to hear from Duke Peltier on how we arrived to the point that we are at right now. In other words, there&#39;s a process. There&#39;s a lot of steps that took place, and Duke is going to tell you about those. I think Daniel Mccoy is going to tell you a bit about the indenture and the Settlement Agreement for this past compensation. And then, as I said, Ryan McLeod will talk a little about the Compensation Disbursement Agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />And you have to keep in mind, folks, that there is still a lot of privilege and confidentiality in the agreement, so they&#39;ll give you all the information we&#39;re able to, and that which we&#39;re not able to we’ll point out to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Thereafter, it&#39;ll be my job to listen to you and other members of your community about your thoughts of the Settlement Agreement and what recommendations you have about how this settlement should work. In particular, I want to hear about how the community or collective needs should be balanced with the individual or per capita needs that you have. I&#39;ll be really anxious to hear about that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I hope that when you are thinking and making recommendations about any of this, you&#39;ll keep in mind what the Robinson Treaty of 1850 was all about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />The Chiefs back in 1850 were true visionaries. In signing the Treaty, their intention was to provide their people with a way to prosper in an everchanging Canada, and that would see their traditional means of livelihood changing along with it. They were concerned for the future of their people and wanted them to be able to share in the monies made through the resources of their territory by the Crown. They were thinking about the future generations of Anishinaabe people and wanted to provide for them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />This vision, I would say, was the one that was accepted by the Canadian courts in their subsequent decisions. For example, the trial court decided that the -- one, the Treaty provided that the original amount of £600, that was about $2,400 at the time was the collective, the community, full community altogether amount; that it was this amount that was to be increased annually if net revenues from the Territory allowed for it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Secondly, the amount of £1, or as it&#39;s become known as $4, originally distributed out of the collective amount to the individual Treaty rights holders was to remain the same each year. And that&#39;s still, I should say, an issue that&#39;s being litigated and is -- or possibly negotiated. But either one, it&#39;s still to be decided, in other words.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />The Court found that the Crown, or Ontario, chose to interpret the Treaty the wrong way almost immediately. They chose to disregard the Chiefs and distribute the £1 to the individuals themselves. This was obviously less expensive than addressing the £600 for the augmentation or increase clause.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />That practice of paying $4 to individual Treaty holders continues to this day. Your legal team will be addressing this issue, as well as going forward in accordance with the Treaty and future litigation and -- or, as I say, negotiations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I should add, this trial decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, which in turn resulted in the Settlement Agreement that we are currently considering.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />As you see, the Compensation Disbursement Agreement -- as you will see, I should say, the Compensation Disbursement Agreement provides for 10 percent of the settlement amount to be set aside for collective or common community purposes; that is, the benefit of all 21 Robinson-Huron First Nations. That&#39;s approximately $1 billion at this time that’s going to be set aside for 21 First Nations and for the community use of 21 -- collective use of the 21 First Nations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />And I want you to think about this, and whatever this money can be used for, virtually anything you can consider; like, maybe future litigation, for example, maybe you can provide for that; a rebuilding of a united Anishinaabe government, possibly; economic development projects or wellness benefits like supplements to retirement or pensions; guaranteed income supplements. These are the thoughts and recommendations that we&#39;re looking for and that we want you to feel free to discuss and talk about and give your opinions on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />After the information discussions and consultations with individual Treaty rights holders, I will be preparing a report for the Litigation Management Committee that will include your views, suggestions, and recommendations. My report will also include my recommendations on how the compensation for past breach of Treaty should be distributed. And again, I want to tell you that there&#39;s a -- I want to search for that balance between the collective portion and the individual, what should go to each individual.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Whether these recommendations are adopted, that&#39;s going to be up to the First Nations, and that includes yours. And as I said, they&#39;ll be recommendations only from me, and you&#39;ll be the ultimate decider.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Finally, I want to want you to know that this session is only the first of several more discussions I will want to have with you, and I will be returning for follow up discussions; consultations, if you will.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Now, at this time, my task is going to be like yours. We&#39;re going to sit and listen about how we got here and what we achieved, and then we&#39;ll decide on what we think as a group you think we should go forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />That&#39;s it. Now we&#39;ll sit down and listen, start with Duke. And Miigwech to everyone.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />All right. Miigwech, Harry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Hey, Matt, do you want to put that presentation up? Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So first off, I want to thank Harry for his comments and explaining the role of Mizhinawe, and what his responsibility is and his anticipated timelines, as well as his commitment to continue hearing your voices in relation to proposed settlement of the annuities past compensation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So, Matt, if you can go ahead there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />I want to also thank the participants that are attending through the online format through Zoom. We want to do -- we do want to say that your questions are recorded and are welcomed, and they will be shared directly with the Office of Mizhinawe. So you can place your questions into the chat there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />We will be going through three presentations. One, I&#39;ll be doing one. Our legal counsel here, Daniel Mccoy, who&#39;s from Batchewana First Nation, representing Nahwegahbow Corbiere. He&#39;ll provide some of the legal context of the agreement, as well as the Trust document. And then we&#39;re going to have a presentation from Ryan McLeod, who&#39;s the Chief Financial Officer and supporting the Mizhinawe team. And he&#39;ll go through the Compensation Disbursement Agreement and what that might mean for your First Nation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So with that, I&#39;m going to get go through the presentation here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Matt next. We can go into the next there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />As far as the history of the litigation, we want to just reiterate that at every single point, right from the start of litigation to the Chief&#39;s last meeting on Wednesday morning in Sagamok, there&#39;s always an element of ceremony that has taken place, whether it&#39;s using a pipe, tobacco, Elders, sweat lodge, entering into the lodge, bringing our eagle staffs together, all of our pipe carriers, ceremony has been at the forefront of developing this case against the Crown to ensure that the annuity promise is respected and that relationship is renewed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And in saying that, one of the approaches that the leadership wished to put forward as part of this litigation, they wanted to ensure that Anishinaabe law and the principles of Anishinaabe law were also respected by the courts, and they wanted to place equal weight between Anishinaabe law and the common law when determining the interpretation of this Treaty in particular.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Next.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And through the guidance of our Elders and ceremony, the leaders and community spent a lot of time and a lot of meetings together over the last number of decades because this this annuity promise in the Treaty was something that has been brought to the attention of the Crown for many years. The annuity itself was only increased once in 1874 to the -- of $4, and through the last couple -- 20, 30 years, there&#39;s been many significant discussions, especially when Canada was repatriating its constitution. There&#39;s been -- there was a delegation of Chiefs that attended some of those meetings that were taking place in London, England at the time in the early eighties. And they wanted to ensure that the Robinson-Huron Treaty, along with many other treaties, were continued to be respected by Canada when it was taking over responsibility of the Crown when it repatriated the Constitution in 1982.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So by doing so, it was determined that there was only one course of action to get the Crown to respect the Treaty relationship between itself and the Robinson-Huron Treaty signatories. And it&#39;s through some of those discussions and one of -- some of the Chiefs; assemblies that they put forward a terms of reference and sought out a firm that would not only provide some advice on how to bring a case forward, but also how to win that case against the Crown. And through the terms of reference, in 2007 they were able to select and retain the firm of Nahwegahbow Corbiere, who provided the advice that in order to bring the claim against the Crown, they need to organize themselves in a collective entity. And then through that advice, they were able to launch the claim and to launch it as a representative action.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And through the representative action, there were six individuals that were named as part of bringing this case forward on behalf of all the beneficiaries. And each of these six representatives were with -- by each of the 21 First Nations and were authorized by a Court Order to bring the claim on behalf of the 21 First Nations and all the Robinson-Huron Treaty beneficiaries. And the six individuals, there&#39;s three of us here tonight: Mike Restoule; Peter Recollet; myself, Duke Peltier; Chief Dean Sayers; Chief Patsy Corbiere; and Roger Daybutch.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />In 2012, after a Chiefs’ assembly took place on August 8th, there was a resolution from the Chiefs that they wish to serve notice of a claim unto Canada, and against their failure to fulfil the annuity promise in the Robinson-Huron Treaty.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And in Canadian, or Canadian and Ontario law, you have you do have to provide notice. But Chiefs also said was they wanted a two-track process. One of them was to not only launch the case, but also to try to secure a negotiated agreement outside of court, and in order to renew the Treaty for the first since 1850 and for it to be consistent with the Anishnaabe law.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And at that time, the Crowns were not -- were never interested in negotiations and claimed that the annuity Augmentation Promise was something that was not a matter that the Court could hear or interpret. And they also said that any increases to the annuity were at their own complete discretion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And so in 2014, the Statement of Claim was filed in the court, which officially commenced litigation against both levels of the Crown. And as part of the advice of the legal team, and in discussions with both Canada and Ontario legal teams, and as well as the judge that was appointed to the case, this case was split into three parts. And it was split into three parts because many times any Treaty-related case that goes before the court, the timelines for going through the court all the way up to the Supreme Court level sometimes takes 30 to 40 years and millions and millions and millions upon -- of dollars.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So what the legal team representing the Robinson-Huron Treaty suggested to the courts, and it was agreed to by the Crowns, was to split the case into three stages. The first stage was to ask the Court to interpret the Augmentation Promise and whether or not that promise was something that was a matter that the Court could make a ruling on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Stage 2 was going to deal with Ontario&#39;s technical defences of limitations and Crown immunity, and those defences with -- that are normally used by the Crowns, the limitation one. In their legislation, they say that if you have a grievance against the Crown, you have two years to bring it before the courts. In our case, we -- they were saying that we should have brought this grievance back in 1876 or 1877. And they also said that they&#39;re immune from any court rulings because they are the Crown. So we -- that was Stage 2. And in Stage 3 was going to deal with any remaining issues, including how much compensation is owed to the Anishinaabek, and how much each level of the Crown is going to be paying out of that amount.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Next.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />In Stage 1 in December 2018, Justice Hennessy released a decision highlighting a major win for the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So some of you may have remembered right before Christmas on December 21st, she released her decision, saying that the annuity is a matter that the Court is prepared and will make a determination on. And she also said that the Crown didn&#39;t have complete discretion on whether or not to increase the annuity. And she also said that the Crown was obligated to increase the annuity when the Crown resource revenues produced from the Treaty territory allowed the Crown to do so without incurring a loss.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And I&#39;ll take a couple paragraphs directly from the Court -- her Court decision of Stage 1. And you can find this court decision in the Ontario Superior Court website. It is a long read, but a very worthwhile read because it does have a lot of our history that&#39;s contained and embedded within it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And in paragraph 463, she says that:</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />“I find that the parties did not intend to limit increases to the annuities to $4 per person. The best possible interpretation of the parties’ common intention, the one that best reconciles their interest, is that the Crown promised to increase the collective annuities, without limit, in circumstances where the Territory produces an amount, as would enable the government to do so without incurring loss. I find that this Treaty promise contained in both the Robinson-Huron Treaty and the Robinson Superior Treaty is a Treaty right protected by the Constitution Act of 1982.” (As read)</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And then the very next paragraph, she says:</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />“Further, the common intention was that the reference to £1 equivalent to $4 in the augmentation clause is a limit only on the amount that may be distributed to individuals. And this distributive amount is a portion of the collective lump sum annuity payable to the Chiefs and their tribes.” (As read)</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So in Stage 2, in her decision in June of 2020, she rejected Ontario&#39;s legal defences that the claim couldn&#39;t be brought against it because we were out of time. And she also rejected Ontario&#39;s claim that they were immune from this action.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Because of these two decisions, Ontario elected to appeal and didn&#39;t agree with Justice Hennessy&#39;s Court Orders. Canada itself, they did not appeal. So Ontario went to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and -- where it issued a single decision on both stages one and two. And -- (audio cut) clause, and further, the Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the Stage 2 -- her Stage 2 decisions.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />We also -- there&#39;s an opportunity for any party to appeal these decisions, and Ontario has once again elected to appeal the Stage 1 Ontario Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court. And this will be held in November, and our legal team is working hard on -- and we also win at the Supreme Court again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And Stage 3 was supposed to have begun in January 23. However, the Treaty leadership instructed legal counsel to suspend Stage 3 in favour of negotiations with Canada and Ontario. And that was as a result of, in the spring of 2022, Canada and Ontario both finally received a mandate to negotiate a resolution to this litigation. And the members of the Litigation Management Committee and members of the legal team made up the negotiation team for the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So discussions took place in spring of 2022, and on December 5th of this past year, the Robinson-Huron Treaty Leadership, Minister Marc Miller, representing Canada, Minister Greg Rickford, representing Ontario, both levels of the Crown, met in Ottawa in ceremony, and commitments were made by all the parties to find a negotiated resolution, and put forward their best efforts to find a resolution to this claim.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And one of the -- I guess the one of the neat facts about this meeting that took place in December is that it was it&#39;s been the first time since the September of 1850 that this Treaty Council met in Bawaating. And one of the things that we continue to be asked, or people do have questions about, is whether this is a new Treaty. We are not negotiating a new Treaty; this is just confirming past compensation for the existing Treaty.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So after several months of discussions and negotiations, the -- an agreement to settle a past compensation to the litigation in the amount of 10 billion was announced on June 17th of 2023, just north of here in Sudbury.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And the collectivity. Justice Hennessy had a little bit of something to say in her Stage 1 decision. In paragraph 371, she said:</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />“The Anishinaabe had an interest in taking steps to ensure the continuance of their collective well-being. They may have wanted at least some per capita payments, but they would have placed the interest of the collectivity at the forefront. The Anishinaabe had an interest in ensuring that the manner that their annuities would be distributed would not be done in a way that risked the loss of the value of the annuity. The Anishinaabe had an interest to secure benefits that would embrace and fulfill Chief Shingwaukonse&#39;s vision of a prosperous Anishinaabe nation within the Euro-Canadian nation state.”</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />When our ancestors participated in the Treaty Council at Bawaating in 1850, they did so with the goal of providing a brighter future for our people. And it&#39;s -- you&#39;ve heard that from Justice Harry LaForme also. And he’s also said that our Chiefs had a vision to enter into this Treaty not just for individual prosperity, but also for the prosperity of our communities and nation. They did so as a result of a quickly changing world. And the original intention of our ancestors was to build a prosperous nation and secure collective benefits from the development and settlement within our territory.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />In Justice Hennessy’s Stage 1 decision, she found that the annuity was a collective annuity. She also confirmed distributions could be made to individuals from the collective annuity.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And we also know that the current annuity is distributed to individuals and has been limited to $4 times the number of beneficiaries. With this settlement, we need to carefully consider what a proper distribution should be so individuals can prosper, as well as what is the proper share to be held at the community level for all of our benefit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And the current compensation agreement is for past annuities from 1850 until the present. This is compensation that should have been paid to the nations and our ancestors many years ago who are no longer with us. In fact, for the first few years, the annuity was paid directly to the Chiefs of each community in goods, and it was up to the Chief to distribute those goods within their communities.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />In the Stage 1 decision. Justice Hennessy refers to some of the historical evidence that was submitted before the Court, and in paragraph 290, she said that:</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />“From 1851 to 1854, the Huron Treaty annuity was paid out in goods to each band; no individual cash payments were made. [However] Starting in 1855 as a result of a number of factors, the Crown paid the annuity to individuals in money.”</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So in saying that, there will be amounts shared or distributed to individuals. Leadership needs to strike the right balance between individual and community needs. And this is what they&#39;ve tasked Mizhinawe and Justice Harry LaForme, as well as his team members, to seek out your views in helping him develop a report that will be relied upon by leadership in determining what that balance is. So as a collectivity, leadership wants to take a uniform approach to distributions to individuals.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So that&#39;s a little bit about the history of the litigation as well as some of the, I guess, the key facts of where -- how we landed, where we&#39;re at today. So with that, I want to pass the microphone over to Daniel Mccoy, who&#39;s going to provide some of the legal aspects of this agreement for you to hear about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Daniel.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Thanks, Duke.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />If we can put my presentation up on the screen? And while Matt&#39;s working on that, I&#39;ll just introduce myself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />My name is Daniel Mccoy; I&#39;m a member of the legal team. I&#39;m also a Treaty beneficiary; I&#39;m a member of Batchewana First Nation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And so I&#39;m going to cover the compensation -- or the Trust indenture a little bit about the Compensation Disbursement Agreement, and then the actual Settlement Agreement itself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />The Settlement Agreement and all of the components of that to my presentation is still subject to settlement privilege, so it&#39;s still confidential. We can share that information with you as members of the community, but it is confidential to the broader public. So as Chief McQuabbie mentioned in his opening comments and Duke mentioned it as well, we are going to work on creating some sort of secure portal so that you could access this information, but it would still be protected from the general public because all of this material is confidential.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And a slide was just -- I&#39;ll talk a little bit about a timeline that we&#39;ll go through. So we can move to the next slide on the Trust indenture.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And so here we go, organizing myself and my own notes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So in 2010, the Chiefs of all 21 communities agreed to create a Trust, and the purpose of that was to be a stable, legal vehicle to pursue the litigation or negotiations with the Crown on behalf of all of the citizens of all 21 communities.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So it does have two purposes that are listed on that slide, and the first is to receive monies from the First Nations and instruct the legal team on litigation or negotiations. And then the second component is to receive any compensation or settlement amount, and then distribute those proceeds in accordance with the Compensation Disbursement Agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So settlement of -- this Settlement Agreement, it won&#39;t end the Trust indenture or the Trust vehicle until we resolve the go-forward or future implementation of the Augmentation Promise. So the purpose was to deal with both the past and the future annuities. And so we have an agreement for the past; we still have to work on the on the go-forward or future implementation component. And in terms of this Settlement Agreement, the legal team and the LMC received instructions to go ahead with this particular Settlement Agreement, which is -- it&#39;s still proposed, so it&#39;s an agreement in principle, but we did initial off on that agreement on June 16th, and then we made our big public announcement in Sudbury the next day on June 17th.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So just briefly on the Compensation Disbursement Agreement, Ryan&#39;s going to cover the mechanics of it, but I&#39;ll just give a little bit of a background.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />One hundred (100) percent of the communities, Trustees, and Chiefs all approved the Compensation Disbursement Agreement. We only required 60 percent, or 13 of the 21 communities, but, in fact, all 21 agreed to it. The Chiefs made their agreement at a Chiefs and Assembly and the Trustees on August 8th, 2012, and then each of the Chiefs and Councils subsequently passed Band Council resolutions from, you know, 2012. We had them coming in as late as 2018; it just took some time to gather all that material. But we did get all 21 First Nations agreeing to the compensation disbursement formula.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />This is this is just what we call the waterfall document. It&#39;s just a visual representation of the Compensation Disbursement Agreement that Ryan will cover in his presentation. So we can just go ahead to the next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So, as I mentioned, or as Duke mentioned, they -- we&#39;ve been meeting regularly with the negotiators for Canada and Ontario since that Treaty renewal ceremony in Ottawa in December 2022. And when I say, “Regular,” we were meeting almost weekly and sometimes it would be for three days in a particular week, and then we&#39;d meet with them again the next week to reach the current proposed Settlement Agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />We have not talked about the go-forward or future implementation of the Augmentation Promise at all. That won&#39;t start until after we complete the past compensation component.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So now I&#39;ll just cover particular parts of the Settlement Agreement. And I&#39;m not going to go over every single section of the agreement; I&#39;m just going to cover the pieces that we think are important. So, like, I&#39;ll start at Article 2; Article 1 is definitions. So I&#39;m just picking the pieces that are probably important to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So the main purpose -- or, I mean, there&#39;s two purposes of the Settlement Agreement. The first is to settle past compensation and renew the Treaty relationship. And that would be done in the spirit of -- and forgive me if I butcher their pronunciation is -- (Ojibwe reference) which is in the language, the principle of reconciliation. And it means to fix or straighten out the relationship between the Anishinaabek and the Crown.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />The second purpose is to make a commitment with Canada and Ontario to negotiate the go-forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So we&#39;ll go to next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Article 3; this is the compensation portion of the agreement. And so the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek and the representative Plaintiffs agree to accept $10 billion as appropriate compensation to achieve those two purposes that -- or achieve the main, first purpose of settling past compensation. And that would be paid out 5 billion from Canada and 5 billion from Ontario. And as I mentioned, it&#39;s for past compensation, so it&#39;s 1850 to the present.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Now, section 4, Article 4. This is important, or I believe this will be important for everyone The Settlement Agreement will not have any effect on your ability or the eligibility of First Nations or individuals to receive funding for programs or services. And so their application, any type of application that an individual or a First Nation would have for funding or services would be assessed as if the Settlement Agreement doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Any individual distributions of past compensation will not affect an individual&#39;s eligibility for Ontario Works or Ontario Disability Support program, as long as the regulations for those programs continue to accept those payments. And we&#39;ve heard from Ontario there is no desire to change those regulations. So if you&#39;re on any type of Social Assistance from Ontario, an individual distribution will have no impact. And then finally, Canada agrees that receipt of past compensation will meet the criteria for income exemption under the Income Tax Act.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />We&#39;ll skip over to Article 7, which is that commitment to negotiate a frame -- or to negotiate the go-forward implementation. And so the Settlement Agreement doesn’t address the future implementation, as I said, but the parties -- so the RHTLF, Canada, and Ontario -- will continue their discussions in the spirit of Treaty renewal to co-develop a framework to address the implementation of the Augmentation Promise going forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />The parties agree that the go-forward implementation agreement will recognize the continuing relationship to and stewardship of the land of the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek, as well as the public interest related to the Treaty territory.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And the implementation agreement will include a dispute resolution process to address any disputes that arise between the parties. And so this is really just we don&#39;t want to go back to court, and I think Duke talked about this in his presentation. The intention was always to negotiate at a nation-to-nation level for this. And in our go-forward agreement, the intention or the hope is really to create a dispute resolution process so we don&#39;t have to go back into court if we have disputes in the future.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br /> We would agree to retain a mediator to assist us where necessary, and that mediation would be conducted in a manner that respects both the Crown and Anishinaabe perspectives and legal orders.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Article 8 is on the approval process. And so Canada and Ontario have agreed that for RTHLF or Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek to approve this, we can use our own process. They&#39;re not going to dictate the approval process.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And so the Trust indenture itself has an approval process for decision-making. And that&#39;s it would be a vote of the Trustees or consensus of the Trustees.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So the first objective is always consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, then we would have an Elder or Elders try to have the Chief, or the Trustees reach a consensus. If they&#39;re unable to have a consensus at that level, then it would go to a vote and 70 percent of the Trustees voting in favour would carry a decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So that will be the approval process for the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek for approving the Settlement Agreement. However, it&#39;s also important to make sure that all of the beneficiaries, you all have information about it. So that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this information process, and Mizhinawe is receiving your feedback, which will also help with other decision-making process throughout. So we&#39;ll be doing this information session -- the information sessions and these consultations before we do the Trustee vote.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Conditions. So like with all Settlement Agreements, there&#39;s always conditions that need to be met before you can do a sign-off on it. And so we would have to approve -- before we can sign off, we would have to approve the Settlement Agreement in accordance with Article 8, which I just discussed. Canada and Ontario will need to receive all of the documents related to those approvals. So there&#39;s a number of different documents that we&#39;ll have to prepare. A lot of it is -- a lot of it is banking documents for actually receiving the money, but we will have to prepare all of those and deliver them to Canada and Ontario, and then Canada and Ontario also have to have their own approval processes met. So they have internal appropriations for spending money. They have their own process, so they&#39;ll have to complete those.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Once that&#39;s done -- so we can go to next slide -- we can execute the agreement. And so it does contemplate that execution will be done in a particular order. First we would sign off, and it would be the Trustees. So there&#39;s one Trustee from each community, and then the six representative Plaintiffs would sign off on behalf of the Robinson-Huron Treaty Anishinaabek, and then the Minister of Indigenous Affairs on behalf of Ontario would sign, and finally the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations on behalf of Canada.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Once the agreement has been signed off, we do have to go back to court to receive a Court Order. And the purpose of that is really just to discontinue the litigation. And so even though the effective date of this Settlement Agreement will be the date that it&#39;s signed, the Settlement Agreement won&#39;t be -- it won&#39;t be in effect until after the Court Order is received. And so our hope is to get that done immediately after it&#39;s signed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And then this is some -- two kind of key points. So it would be living beneficiaries as of the effective date. So everyone who is alive on the effective date, the date that we sign the agreement, would be entitled to a distribution. And so we may have to deal with some estates. So, you know, if -- our goal is to execute the agreement on September 9th, which is the anniversary of the Treaty. So everyone who would be alive as of September 9th would be entitled to a distribution; however, if people pass away between September 9th and the date that communities are actually able to make a distribution, we may have to deal with the -- with estates at that point.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So we&#39;ll go to next slide.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And this is this is really important because your community, I&#39;m sure you have you other claims, most communities have other claims against Canada and Ontario for their non-fulfilment of the Treaty in other -- or other aspects of the Treaty. And so this Settlement Agreement will have no impact or -- and will not prevent your community from bringing another claim related to the Treaty, as long as it&#39;s not about the augmentation, promise, and annuities. And then if there&#39;s the possibility of the same compensation, so resource revenues being paid twice, all that would happen is Canada and Ontario would take that double payment -- or Canada and Ontario can ask a Court to take into consideration that double payment, and so maybe the compensation might be a little bit less. But for many claims that it would be loss of use, and loss of use doesn&#39;t really -- wouldn&#39;t be impacted here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />And then finally, nothing in the Settlement Agreement amends or modifies the Treaty itself. And so Duke talked about that in his presentation as well. We didn&#39;t renegotiate the Treaty; the Treaty has not been amended or modified in any way. This is just about implementing the Treaty promise.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So my final slide is just a brief timeline for the settlement process. So as I mentioned, we initialled the agreement on June 26th -- or June 16th. We made our announcement on June 17th, the next day. We&#39;re now in community information sessions and engagement sessions, which started in June, and they&#39;ll go through to, you know, the latter part of August.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Once that&#39;s complete, we can get ready for executing the Settlement Agreement. And as I mentioned, our goal is to do that on September 9th, which is the anniversary of the Robinson-Huron Treaty. However, this is dependent on different factors, primarily, it would be Canada&#39;s appropriation process. So before Canada can sign, they do have to appropriate the money, which means it has to go through Parliament, and that hasn&#39;t been done yet. So they&#39;ll have to do that before they can sign off on the agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />After the agreement is signed off and we have our Court Order, Canada and Ontario would be paying -- it would be at least 60 days after that Court Order. So the goal would be around November 9th, if we execute on September 9th for compensation to be paid to the Robinson-Huron Treaty Litigation Fund. And then payments one and two, which Ryan will talk about what payments one and two are, but payments one and two would be able to be made shortly after the funds are received. And then Mizhinawe will prepare a report to the Chiefs and Councils sometime between December and March; like, this December and March of 2024. And then the third priority payment. It could be up to two years after the funds are received, and Ryan will we&#39;ll talk about what priority payment 3 is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Per capita distributions. I&#39;ve just put this in there. It would be determined by each individual First Nation, but I think a reasonable goal would be sometime in mid-2024 when individual payments to individuals could be made.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So that&#39;s the end of my presentation, and I&#39;ll pass it over to Ryan, and Ryan will walk you through the Compensation Disbursement Agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Miigwech, Daniel.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Good afternoon, Aanii, my name is Ryan, and I am a financial advisor assigned to support the Mizhinawe&#39;s office and the Litigation Management Committee.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />I am the Chief Financial Officer for Batchewana First Nation and the former -- in the same role in Sagamok for approximately three years. And I&#39;m very happy to be here speaking to the community today and supporting this process.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So we do have a presentation that we&#39;ll put on the screen, talking about the Disbursement Agreement. And you&#39;ll look -- you&#39;ll be able to see the priority areas in which the payments will be made.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So I just want to emphasize that the settlement is not finalized until it&#39;s signed, and I think it&#39;s been shown today how important it is to get to that signing date. It is a global settlement of $10 billion, which, you know, is a great, great settlement for the communities in the Treaty area.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />And how the calculations are going to be made. So there are a number of factors that we continue to assess, and we&#39;ll show you that in detail around population, annuitants, and finalizing costs. So we&#39;re going to show all of that as we go through for the community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So the Compensation Disbursement Agreement was approved by the 21 communities in 2012, as you heard. It is the way the funds flow down to the community level from the litigation fund. So once the funds come to your community, we&#39;ll be making recommendations to support your Chiefs and Council on how the next steps are, but it will be the community&#39;s decision how the funds are used. And the Disbursement Agreement has three priority areas which we&#39;ll look at in detail.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So this is just to show this is the formal waterfall diagram along with the Disbursement Agreement that was signed and agreed to in 2012. So we just wanted to show what it looked like, but we&#39;re going to cover each area in more detail.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So Priority 1. So after the funds are received into the litigation fund, there are a number of things that need to be paid back or paid off and covered. So that includes bank fees, legal fees, bank loan, and any other associated costs, so we&#39;ll take care of paying those back, as well as cash contributions made by communities prior to the Trust being established and after the Trust was established, as well as interest on those contributions made or guaranteed by each community, both pre- and post-Trust at 25 percent.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So for Henvey Inlet, before the Trust was established, there was a $40,000 contribution. Since the Trust has been established, $620,100 has been contributed to the Trust to support the operations and the litigation. The community will also receive all of this money back, plus interest of 237,650. So the total coming back to the community of all your contributions plus interest, 825,125. There is a Bank of Montreal loan that&#39;s in place that some communities opted to support, opposed to putting cash in. But in your instance, you chose to contribute cash because you were in a strong enough position to do that, so you&#39;ll receive interest back on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So every community has a similar breakdown based on what they&#39;ve done. So all of those cash contributions and interest will be repaid.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Once the costs are off the top, we&#39;re able then to start distribution to the communities. So the first 50 percent we&#39;ll speak about in Priority 2.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Thirty-nine (39) percent of the settlement will be divided equally amongst the 21 communities. There will be 1 percent held for individual annuitants that are not members of a settlor First Nation. So those are individuals that are entitled to the annuity payment but are now members of another community outside the Treaty area, but they still collect their annuity. So they&#39;ll be able to make application for their per capita distribution to that area funds. If the funds are not all used, they&#39;ll be equally divided amongst the communities as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />There&#39;s a 10 percent set aside for collective purpose, and that is -- was decided in 2012 to support collective needs and future battles. And this afternoon, there&#39;ll be several questions that Mizhinawe&#39;s office will ask, and one of them will be, “What would you see those funds being used for?” So you&#39;ll be able to make some input and contribution into what your vision is, and I&#39;m sure your Chief and Council will make those comments as well to the litigation fund as we move forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So from there, we move to the final 50 percent of the settlement. And this is where it&#39;s a little bit more challenging and why the timeline is pushed out a little ways.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Priority 3 is made up of two components, one on population and one on annuitants, and there is a distinct difference.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So in your community, there&#39;s approximately 1,200 and I think the Chief mentioned and six as of, you know, recently; this information was obtained from ISC back in June. Their data was showing 1,209. So we recognize the data is continuously moving and it&#39;s not always accurate from ISC. So what the Mizhinawe&#39;s office will be doing is speaking with each community, to their membership team, and obtaining direct information from each community, as well as which membership code or if you follow INAC&#39;s process. So we&#39;ll be collecting all of that information from each community, and then being able to calculate the appropriate population numbers as we move forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So what does that mean for the territory? So every community, once they verify their population, we can then work to the total population across the territory, which will help us determine what each community will get in the first 25 percent.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />The second 25 percent is on the number of annuitants within the territory. This is a challenging area because there are six communities that currently only approximately 50 percent of their members or less are recognized as annuitants. But in lots of those instances, it wasn&#39;t the family&#39;s choice to be; they were forced out of the Treaty and into the Manitoulin Treaty. So we&#39;re continuously working through that information and trying -- and the Mizhinawe&#39;s office will make recommendations on what the best approach is moving forward. But in Henvey’s instance it&#39;s showing equal the population to annuitants.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So that will drive the final 25 percent portion of the payout. This is the largest -- this area here is the most challenging area for us as we do the calculations, because we need the total amount of both population and annuitants in order to finalize the calculations, as well as each individual community&#39;s numbers. So we&#39;ve started this work. We&#39;re going to continue to work through the fall as the settlement hopefully becomes official, and we&#39;ll be working really hard into early 2024 to have those numbers finalized with each community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />We have begun a process of, hopefully, helping communities and -- with their per capita distribution. We&#39;re looking at a number of areas around per capita; what&#39;s been successful, what hasn&#39;t been successful. And we&#39;re going to be making recommendations to the Chiefs and Councils, but at the end of the day, through community consultation, I&#39;m sure your community will come to a resolution on what the per capita will be, based on what the Chief said earlier, but we will be providing some supporting documents to help along the way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So the community sessions started on June 26th. Where it will be concluding, it&#39;s actually August 19th is the last session for the first round. We’ll then be starting second sessions in in September, moving through to November as we come closer to the potential payout date.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So what does the timeline look like? It&#39;s kind of broken down into three main phases. Phase 1: Community engagement, economic research and analysis, and data collection; Phase 2 from June till early 2024, the Mizhinawe’s report will be worked on, financial and population annuitant data verification will be underway. And then we&#39;re hoping in December or early 2024 that the actual funds will flow to the litigation fund. And from there we can issue Priority 1 and Priority 2 payments, hopefully right away, like Daniel mentioned. And then we&#39;ll be working on Priority 3 payments to each community.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So there is a lot of work to go ahead and move this forward, but it&#39;s well underway.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So miigwech for the opportunity to present this afternoon to your community. We&#39;re happy to take questions or comments as we move forward throughout the afternoon.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So miigwech.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />All right. So miigwech, Ryan.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So that concludes the presentation. So we&#39;ll open it up for some questions before we get into the breakout discussions. Are there any questions? Clear as mud.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah, we got a microphone over here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />So I didn&#39;t get a clear understanding of the pie chart and where all the money&#39;s exactly getting disbursed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />A clear understanding of where all the money&#39;s getting disbursed to?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah. That&#39;s still very unclear for me. I&#39;d like to have it in front of my face here. I don&#39;t know if I if you guys made any booklets about this or...?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />With all this information that you&#39;ve been showing us, I kind of like to read over it again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />I think that&#39;ll be part of our ongoing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />Yeah,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />But I think if you&#39;re looking at it, a pie -- half the pie is by population, and the other half is -- 39 percent of that other half is equal amongst 21 communities; 10 percent is going to be kept for Treaty-related issues, (audio cut) -- for those annuitants that are not members of the 21 First Nations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />Okay. All this information&#39;s reviewable somewhere.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah, Yeah. The -- once the internal portal on Henvey Inlet First Nation website, once that&#39;s established, information will be available to you there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 12:: </strong><br />That would have been nice to know before this meeting. That&#39;s it for me for now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So we have another question in front, second row here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 13:: </strong><br />I think he addressed that. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s a lot of information today. I was trying to scribble stuff; there&#39;s just so much of it. All we can do is just thank all the members that have put their effort in. But I would really like to, like you said, if there&#39;s the portal, if we can find out as soon as possible so that we can be better prepared for the breakout sessions; you know what I mean, the second breakout session? I think that would be a really great idea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah. Like we&#39;re -- the announcement was on June 17th, and in order to have this agreement finalized -- and we were aiming for September the 9th, and as part of the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement itself, we have to have community engagement sessions, and we have to get them in 21 communities in that timeframe. So we hope to get all the information out and it will be made available on your community&#39;s website for -- in your members-only site.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 14:: </strong><br />Hi. You lost me there when you’d said about people passing away after September. The reason I&#39;m asking, my father got diagnosed with lung cancer, and he&#39;s got eight months to live; that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah, the agreement becomes effective once it&#39;s signed, so we want to get it signed as soon as possible. And the date we&#39;re aiming for is September the 9th.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 14:: </strong><br />Thank you, sir.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah, the Chief might have further comments on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Yeah, I had that very discussion with Duke outside here while the Mizhinawe was doing his presentation. And for us, you know, once that agreement is signed and the community consultations start, that is going to be a first priority for the Band. You know, there won&#39;t be any funds released from the annuities claim, and -- but our Band is in a position where we can discuss that and come to a consensus. We do have a wind farm; we are sitting on funds.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />I understand the situation with your dad, but it&#39;s others, too, that are in that position. We want to ensure that, you know, they get to enjoy those annuities before their life is done.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />So again, as soon as the agreement is signed, we&#39;re going to hold community sessions and we&#39;re going to have those discussions and see how we can roll that out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to take a minute here because, you know, the six main people up there that have got this going, props to you guys, honestly. You know, to do this for not just us here, but for 21 First Nations and the populations within those nations, that&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m really thrilled that you guys did this for us.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />I guess I understand the majority of the presentation that you guys put on, like, right from the -- what is it, the Priority 1 and 2 payments, and that&#39;s the, like, paying back everything, right? Okay. So then the Priority 3 payment that would be to the individuals. Is that right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So the formula on the Compensation Disbursement Agreement, and we can definitely put it back up on the screen for everyone so they can see it again. I know it&#39;s a lot of information at once, especially if you&#39;ve never seen it before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />This is just the method to get the funds to the community itself. So the first in Priority 2, 39 percent will come equally to the 21 communities. And then obviously the other major piece is the 50 percent, which is 25 on your community&#39;s population and 25 percent on your annuitants.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So that is the biggest challenge area for us as we verify the totals and each community’s amount. But we expect to pay Priority 1, which is the costs and your money back that&#39;s been contributed, as well as Priority 2 payment right away once the settlement is completed, because those are very straightforward calculations to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />So then that third payment is where it comes to the members itself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Yeah. So either way, all the funds come to your community, and then it&#39;s going to be up to your community sessions to determine how that gets disbursed to the members. This was just the formula that was agreed to ---</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Okay. So then 1 and 2 goes to the first, goes to the Chief and council, whatever, to the Band. And then through that money, that&#39;s what gets disbursed to the members.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Correct.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Okay. See, that&#39;s what I was ---</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Yeah. So at your community level. So it&#39;ll be the 39 percent plus the other 50 percent.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />So 89 percent will come to your community based on those variables. From there, you&#39;ll be able to then work through what it looks like for each member and what it looks like for your community as a collective.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Okay. So then one last question before I give up ---</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />--- this microphone is, now I know one of you guys made the statement, I can&#39;t remember which one it was, but is that moving forward with this Treaty every, what, year we&#39;ll get more than $4?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Yeah, so I hope so. So it&#39;ll definitely be more than $4, but for the time being, because we haven&#39;t addressed that issue, you would receive $4 this year -- and I hope it&#39;s not next year, but it could be -- like, it might take us some time to do that negotiation. But going forward, it would be more than $4 that individuals would be entitled to. So we&#39;re -- but we do have to work on that, and we want to start that work as soon as we get this one wrapped up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Yeah, because that&#39;s what I understand, is that this whole thing is from 1850 to now, but is it moving forward that we&#39;re still going to be getting more than the four bucks, or not?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />Yeah. And we will get -- we will work on getting you more than $4 in the future.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 15:: </strong><br />Thank you very much; you know, very poor. Thank you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Yeah, I think a little bit further to that is the -- it took us some time to get Canada and Ontario to secure a mandate to negotiate, so they don&#39;t have a mandate yet for the $4 amount. They only had a mandate to negotiate the past compensation. But together, together we can make some change. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, we&#39;re hoping to get it more than $4, and we want to do that as soon as possible.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />There&#39;s no more questions. We&#39;re going to take a short -- oh, sorry</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 16:: </strong><br />Thank you. Good afternoon.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 16:: </strong><br />The previous member eloquently asked what I was going to ask, and she hit both points. However, on behalf of myself and my family, I can imagine the tremendous amount of work that has gone into this so far. I want to thank you all for what you&#39;ve done.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 16:: </strong><br />The only thing I have to say is that we have to study this. This is a lot of system overload for myself, and I&#39;m sure a bunch of the members. When we get a chance to study it, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have more questions.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Okay. Miigwech for that. Yeah, and Justice Harry LaForme did indicate earlier that there will be follow-up sessions, likely Zoom. It&#39;s probably easier for him in relation to travel because he has committed to having follow-up sessions with each of the 21 communities. And so once he gets through his initial drafting, he&#39;ll be looking for further commentary to support his recommendations. And hopefully by that time we&#39;ll have the information available on their members portal sites.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Another question here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 17:: </strong><br />So I know it&#39;s Chief Wayne said in his opening remarks that according to ISC, we have 1,209 members. Obviously, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware we&#39;re going through our membership code process. So as of now, we don&#39;t necessarily recognize those 1,209 members as members of Henvey. What protections are being given for those people that are currently on our waiting list to ensure they get their portion of this distribution?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Chief. Chief would like to answer that. Chief has the answers today.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />I wish I had all the answers.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />In relation to the 200 or so that are in waiting, they&#39;ve already been identified with Indigenous Services Canada, so they are recognized as Status Indians. And the 1,206 members I believe we identified, they&#39;re included in that; they&#39;re also a part of that, you know, the ones in waiting. They&#39;re identified in the 1,206 already. So they are going to be recipients of the settlement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />No, they won&#39;t fall in that 1 percent. You know, the 1 percent will be the stragglers for the annuitants. But the plan moving forward, you know, we&#39;ll have money as a collective also, right? So the stragglers we can look after out of those monies. We&#39;ll make sure -- if there&#39;s a Trust established, we&#39;ll make sure that&#39;s identified in the Trust.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Speaker 17:: </strong><br />So if we don&#39;t add them to our list, we&#39;re still going to pay them their ---</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>CHIEF McQUABBIE:: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McCOY:: </strong><br />So I just want to add one other piece to Chief McQuabbie&#39;s comments, and it really aligns with what the legal team, LMC, and what the Chiefs heard at the very get-go of this case: The Elders made it very clear; “You can&#39;t leave anyone behind.” So that&#39;s why in the Compensation Disbursement Agreement and in the Trust indenture, it talks about defining a beneficiary. And it&#39;s in accordance with Anishinaabe law, not in -- not in the Indian Act or Indigenous Services Canada, what they say; it&#39;s what we say at the community level, that we will decide who our membership is and who our beneficiaries are. And that&#39;s also part of the reason why the 1 percent was created for the stragglers, because the Elders were very clear: “Don&#39;t leave anyone behind.” So I just wanted to add that to Chief McQuabbie&#39;s comments.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />And maybe I&#39;ll add to Daniel&#39;s comments. Just the reason we used Indigenous Services Canada&#39;s information was obviously the turnaround time was very quick. They were able to produce the information, like, at the click of a mouse pretty much, within a day or so. So then we were able to present the data to each community since it started. And, really, it&#39;s just a starting point so you can see the approximate total across the 21 communities and see the challenge we&#39;re faced with around the annuitant population. So I just wanted to add that as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Yeah, so we&#39;re working with each community to have their membership code recognized, understand what each community uses, and then be able to put that into the calculation, so....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. McLEOD:: </strong><br />Miigwech.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Any further questions? All right. We did a good job today, guys.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So we&#39;re going to take a short little break and allow the Mizhinawe&#39;s team to here to get set up for the breakout session. So we&#39;re going to be asking you to not leave; your work is still required here, and you need to help us out. All right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So in about 10 minutes we’ll probably -- five minutes, we’ll get started.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Probably 10 minutes; there&#39;s only one bathroom here. And don&#39;t get scared. There&#39;s somebody sitting on a chair inside that room.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MS. COMMANDA: </strong><br />Aanii our online friends. We do have a breakout session as well. We will be going over the same questions that they&#39;re doing in person in the common room. So we will have a five-minute break so you can have a chance to grab water, have a little break, and then we&#39;ll get started. In about five minutes, I will open the breakout rooms. Yeah. So see you shortly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MS. COMMANDA: </strong><br />All right. I&#39;m going to open up the breakout rooms, so something should pop up on your screen and you can join. And we will be going over the same questions that they are going over together in person. We have our online facilitators ready to capture your comments. So I&#39;m in Group 2. My group, it&#39;ll be a minute behind you, just as I make sure everyone is able to join. So I&#39;ll open those up now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MS. COMMANDA: </strong><br />What? Oh, you... All right. There&#39;s a bit of a tech issue; we&#39;re going to have to redo these rooms. Hold on. Okay, sorry, everybody. You have to rejoin your room. We have a tech issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Okay, we have four tables set up. So if you can maybe make your way to one of the tables. There are no takers there. Help with recording your comments. The questions are all the same at each table.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />All right. I think we&#39;re done at the sessions -- breakout sessions here. I think. I know these guys are still giving her. Any more to add? No. You&#39;re good? Okay. So we&#39;re going to have a couple closing comments from Justice Harry LaForme, Mizhinawe.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Harry, are you still there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Miigwech, Duke. Yep, I&#39;m still here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Okay, we&#39;re going to get Matt to put you up on the screen here. Hold on, hold on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />We&#39;re going to get to that here, Jennifer. All right, Harry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Okay. Miigwech, everyone, for the turnout and for your input, that&#39;s going to be very valuable to us.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />I have a couple of comments that I&#39;d like to make. One, and I&#39;ve thought about this, and Duke mentioned it earlier and he said, aside from the legal aspects of the trial decision, that decision itself is really, really good on telling a little bit of history about the Robinson-Huron Treaty and how it was made and what the First Nations thought, and some of those arguments that were made. And I think don&#39;t even read it for the law, but just read it for a little bit of the history of how this came about. And I think -- and it&#39;s good reading. I mean, it&#39;s not like really complicated legal nonsense or anything like that. So by all means; go ahead and read it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />And second of all, I would like to say none of these -- this is not the end of these sessions. You can answer the questions, and even more go beyond the questions if you want with your comments and your suggestions. I know you&#39;re going to go away and you&#39;re going to talk about this, and you might get other ideas and you might be informed by your neighbours or your family and whatnot, and you should provide those comments in the -- Duke, do we have it up, or we got a website? Yeah, there you go. And including today&#39;s, so -- and there&#39;s a lot on that website as well that you can -- there&#39;s an email, but we have a website also and you should check it out because there&#39;s a lot of useful information up there that I think you&#39;ll be interested in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Anyways, you were terrific group. Thank you very much for coming out. And this whole process is about you and your comments and questions and concerns. So miigwech to all of you for participating</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Miigwech, Duke.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />Okay. Miigwech, Harry, and the question before you started there was, is there an opportunity to provide information directly to you if they -- and you&#39;ve answered that and there is an email there. Maybe, Matt, can you put the email up larger? I see -- I&#39;ve seen my friends here squinting, so -- there we go. Little -- a little larger. There; I think we can see it there now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JUSTICE LaFORME:: </strong><br />Great.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So yeah, if you have any further comments that -- if you go home tonight or in the next few days, that a lightbulb goes off in your head, that you want to offer some comments about Mizhinawe and to Mizhinawe, and in relation to what you&#39;ve heard today, you can use the email.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />And as for myself representing the LMC and my co-presenters here, I want to say Miigwech to everyone for being patient with us and being kind and especially hearing -- it&#39;s good to hear that you&#39;re appreciative of some of the work that&#39;s been done on your behalf. We&#39;ve heard many, many comments, but it&#39;s also nice to hear good comments. So we say miigwech for that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />But I do want to stress to you that, I guess, some of the main points that you might have heard today; one is that the $4 annuity, there&#39;s a chance that it&#39;s still going to be $4 next year. We&#39;re working on that, and we&#39;re going to work on that once this agreement is signed off and finalized and we&#39;re aiming to have that done by September the 9th. There is a Treaty gathering in Bawaating on September 7th, 8th, and 9th; Bawaating is Sault Ste. Marie. So I think there&#39;s -- if you&#39;re wishing to go, there&#39;s many educational sessions, many other community members that are from other communities that’ll be there. There&#39;ll be presentations and we&#39;re -- like I said, we&#39;re hoping to have the agreement finalized and signed off, so there will be the Crown representatives there doing that on behalf of the Crown. And then that&#39;s when the clock starts ticking and we can look to having Ryan doing his work and finalizing numbers, and hopefully -- and I&#39;ll say hopefully -- we can get some funds out to the communities by 2024.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />So in saying that, don&#39;t go buying cars or boats or -- wait till there&#39;s actual a notice; a notice given that funds are received by the Trust and they&#39;re going to be transferred to the communities.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>MR. PELTIER:: </strong><br />But what I do want to encourage you to continue doing is to have these community dialogues with your leadership. Support them, support your Trustee. They&#39;ll have information when it becomes available. We&#39;ll share information when it becomes available. And I do want to say that we haven&#39;t gotten to this place because we were divided. We&#39;ve been successful so far because we&#39;ve been united. And I want to encourage yourselves, as representatives and members of Henvey Inlet First Nation to continue being united as a community, continue having these kinds of dialogue sessions, talk with each other, not at each other.
